# P3

## Get Started

When starting the program, you will have to configure the program to connect to the right database. 
Access information can be found in db-settings.txt in the root of this repository.
A local database can be set up using the db-setup.sql script.

Once you have the right connection, you will need to be authenticated to actually gain access to the system.
To do this, write us an email with the information that you see on the error screen on the program, when you try to log in:

!!! Access denied !!!<br>
User "DOMAIN-NAME\username" is not authorized to access this application.

We need the "DOMAIN-NAME\username" part.
